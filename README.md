# i honestly have no idea if i'm doing this right, it's my first time using github (and also my first c# project!)
this is a simple project that lets you:
 - create a question with its own answer and save it in a .txt file
 - load the question

this isn't that creative (even for a first project) and it's specially not high quality, but i had fun learning how to save and read .txt files!
